This is a fun-filled medieval cartoon 2D style real-time strategy (RTS) game. In the game, you will act as a medieval lord, freely constructing core buildings such as castles, cottages, barracks, archery ranges, monasteries, and defense towers to build your unique medieval city-state. The day-night cycle mechanism injects a unique rhythm into the game: by day, you need to command your people to collect various resources with all their strength to lay a solid foundation for the development of the city-state; when night falls, danger follows. You must rely on carefully arranged defensive facilities and well-trained troops to fend off waves of fierce attacks from enemies and guard the peace of your homeland.
